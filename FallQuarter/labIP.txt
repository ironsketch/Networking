1)	10.20.76.40
2)	ICMP 1
3)	payload (data) said it is 28bytes total length is 98 so 98 - 28 is what the rest of the packet sent is
4)	fragment offset = 0. So it is fine.
5)	Source changes, destination is always ME!
6)	Mine needs to stay me so it comes to me. Otherwise I will be lonely and sad.... with no data....
7)	If you are asking about achange in the desc., mine only says TTL expired. I never get ECHO.
8)	Identification: 0x095f (2399)
	Time to live: 56
9)	My guess (also from researching the interwebz) is that TTL is related to the Response time! And that it isn't the same based on how long it takes to get back. It's the raw time. ID always changes. It looks like a hex of some kind. I am not sure what that is used for except maybe it holds the window number?
10) I had to download the wireshark zip for this. YES there is fragmentation. 
11)	Fragment offset: 1480
	2000 bytes
I need a wireshark file to do this... :/

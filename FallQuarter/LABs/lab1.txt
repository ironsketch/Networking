Lab 1
Michelle Bergin collaberated with Shreyas Raman
------------------
| What I did     |
I downloaded and installed Wireshark on my Mac. 
I hit the shark button and played around with what I was seeing.
I loaded the page asked of me and observed the packets captured.
I had a lot of questions for Shreyas who knew more of what was going on and about the raw bytes. The actual data sent in hex.

------------------
| What I learned | 
Most interesting, I noticed that when we had to load that simple HTML file, one of the packets captured was a 404 error. I remember how those used to be used OFTEN back on 2000 or so when I first started to make websites. So I wanted to find out why. With Shreyas's help we found a favicon was trying to be loaded which throws a 403 error, so I think it's related to that since I do not see any other call to any other source. It really is interesting to think about HOW MUCH is being processed with such a simple HTML file.

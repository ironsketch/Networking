LAB2

What we did:
	Questions from the Wireshark lab (below at QUESTIONS::)
	I also started on the UDPPinger. The reason this is late turning in is because I still wanted to give it a whirrl before I turned this in. But I got distracted and I forgot. I am still going to try the UDPPinger later. I will submit an addendum if I do so.

What I learned:
	I accidentally went to the first Wireshark link and so when I went to accomplish the first task it didn't capture any HTTP responses. I tried and tried and nothing changed. Eventually, finally, I got a 304 message and an HTTP request was found. My assumption is that the simple website was locally cached so that it requested the information without sending an HTTP request. I assume that eventually the cache time frame timed out and it finally sent a new call.	
	
	I am also learning that I love Python. Not related but I am really enjoying learning C++ and have realized that learning Java in an IDE I think took away some glamour of programming because it does so much for you. I enjoy having control over my computer. During our lab Rosemary and I talked about how to modify terminal to have a kitty in the corner. My first thought was that there is no way. But then I realized that I am a programmer and there is probably very much a way to do so :D Albeit I may not be learned enough to do it but I could! and will!

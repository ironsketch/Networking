4)
	All DNS are using UDP.

5)
	If it's responding it's sending through 53, if it is recieving it is recieving over 53. All other ports are random. (maybe not random, maybe each server/ system handles it differently. maybe per application port)

6)
	10.12.1.10 it's the same address.

7)
	I think 'type' is query and specific is A name. The answer was CNAME and A

8)
	2 answers were provided. The first is a call to a CNAME ianawww.vip.icann.org (not to be confused with icanhascheezburger) Typically www. is an A name record so it makes sense that it was some weird ianawww

	The second was an a record request from the CNAME request I believe.
9) 
	If I found the right SYN message then it was my IP address.

10)
	It's so convoluted it's hard to see. I have 100's of messages. But from what I can see, (I ordered the messages by time) there is no DNS message sent between website file and image file.

11) 
	Query destination port: 53
	Source port of response: 53

12)
	It's sent the the DNS server my computer has been using Destination: 10.12.1.10
	Source for response ip: the same

13)
	Sent for a type A and got in return CNAMEs and A names

14) 
	3 answers are sent:
	1) www.mit.edu: type CNAME, class IN, cname www.mit.edu.edgekey.net
	2) www.mit.edu.edgekey.net: type CNAME, class IN, cname e9566.dscb.akamaiedge.net
	3) e9566.dscb.akamaiedge.net: type A, class IN, addr 23.41.252.65

I tried the rest got time outs. I can get to it later but I get the idea. (i hope!)

1) UDP
2) 	Frame 2, Source:68, Port:67, StreamIndex: 0
		DHCP Request
	Frame 7, Source:67, Port:68, StreamIndex: 1
		DHCP Discover
	Frame 936, Source:68, Port:67, StreamIndex: 0
		DHCP Offer
	Frame 941, Source:67, Port:68, StreamIndex: 1
		DHCP ACK

My Wireshark crashes often so these numbers have changed ^

3) I am using a4:5e:60:df:24:89

4) Request has no IP addresses yet and has a section to request many things:
	Parameter Request List Item: (1) Subnet Mask
	Parameter Request List Item: (121) Classless Static Route
	Parameter Request List Item: (3) Router
	etc...

5) 	Transaction ID: 0xc09e3f32
	Transaction ID: 0xc09e3f33
	To keep track of requests?

6) 	DHCP server identifier
	10.12.1.1src, 10.20.76.13dst

7) 10.12.1.1

8) 10.20.76.13

9) 	Yes there is a relay agent: 10.20.76.1
	For the lab screen shot, their relay agent is 0.0.0.0 indicating no relay agent

10) From what I learned a subnet mask is used to help disperse IP's based on location? and it looks like the router is the relay agent. Used for controlling ip flow? 

11) ACK accepts the IP address

12) I keep my IP for 90 days. Since each computer needs one, but most students aren't here for more than the quarter, it's good to refresh that pool of ip's. That way there are IP's to go around.

13) my wireshark kept crashing...

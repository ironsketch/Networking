ping intmain.in

1) 	my host 10.20.76.40
	destination host 198.71.233.214
2) 	Because it does not use ports. It is only sending to touch the other server and get a response, it doesn't need to access anything else.
3)	Type is either 8 or 0 for request or reply
	Code is always 0
	Checksum, Identifier, Sequence number, Request frame, Response time, time stamp from icmp data and relative, data 48bytes
	length is 98 so all the rest has to be within 48 bytes
4)	Same as above
5) 	Host and dest host are the same. 
6)	It would be 17
7)	it only has a lot more fields vs before
8)	IP protocol and the user datagram
9) 	Wire shark keeps crashing.
10) This I am confused about

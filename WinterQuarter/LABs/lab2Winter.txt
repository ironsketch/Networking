Lab2
Michelle Bergin

We did another SSH Inception. This time it was Total Recall.
This one was a lot more fun to run through. I felt it had a good flow where I could learn more command line tools and not feel stuck.

I enjoyed this lab and the most I learned was about using nc to find a port used by narrowing down the possibilities.
I also learned about nmaping a range of IPs. I need more practice and I would like to finish Total Recall. The server was shut down accidentally.

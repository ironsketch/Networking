Chapter 1 in Weidman:
Installing Kali Linux was a bust. It would not work with the image given in class. I tried my best.
So what I did was when I went home I downloaded the latest virtualbox img and ran that. It worked!
I have been installing and going through CH1 and I am now at installing the android SDK. I am getting an error.
What I will do this week is skip that and continue through CH2

Haven't gone through CH2 yet but you posted on the website that it is mostly command line information. I'll enjoy learning more!

CH5 P4) I admit I don't know what I am doing. I have listened in class. Read the book, used online tutorials and examples. I am just lost...

CH5 p14)
	a) eBGP because it is out of the internal AS
	b) OSPF because it is internal info but not internal within other AS
	c) iBGP because it is within the same AS
	d) RIP because it is internal info but not internal within other AS

CH6 R4)
	There would be a collision when they arrive at the next node. If the transmission rate and length is the same, they will arrive at the same time.

CH6 R5)
	Aloha is simple and it allows for the full frame to send.
	Token Passing - no master node and I am not sure about the next

CH6 R8)
	Sometimes information hasn't yet reached another node. If one node only senses that 'unused' node it will start sending. Thus a collision.

CH6 R9)
	MAC 2^48, IPv4 2^32, IPv6 2^128

CH6 R10)
	NO. It sends with the MAC address which is translated by the ARP and it gets sent to the right PC. Otherwise if it was the broadcast MAC address, then yes C would get the ARP request but return the wrong MAC address where as B would send the correct one returning to question 1.

CH6 R11)
	An ARP query is sent to ensure that the frame is sent to the correct computer. Each computer has a wireless/hardware internet physical card. Each of those has a MAC address. It's like an IP address. The ARP handles translation of IP and MAC address like DNS with hostname and IP.

CH6 R12)
	NO. *pretending Aip sent* Aip wants to send to Bip. It doesn't get the MAC address of Bip which is on a different subnet. It gets the sending side of ARPs MAC address. Both sides of ARP will talk to eachother but not send share Aip's MAC addy

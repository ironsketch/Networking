P14)
	a) help
	b) All devices except switches have MAC addresses. These were given from the hardware of each.
	c) E will send the request to the first router which sends it to the next router which sends it to B. Nothing direct.
	d) E will get it's IP address from the DHCP service. But in order to get info from B, E will need to get the MAC address of B. But E can't get that directly It will need to go through a router. It will get the router MAC address and the router will get the MAC address of the second router and that router will get the MAC address of B. 

P15)
	a) The round ones are routers right? No it will just get switched to F if the MAC address and IP is already known.
	b) Yes it will make the request. If the close router is now a switch it will go through the second round router.
